One.

What would Ted like to get for his room?

Wow!

Your room looks great, Ted.

I really like your posters.

Thanks.

They were a present from my brother.

And this desk looks really useful.

Yes, it's great for doing my homework.

The only thing I need now is a sofa.

I want a big, comfortable one to go under the window.
