Track 155.

You will hear Callum talking to his friend Stella about going to a skate park.

Shall we go to the new skate park tomorrow, Stella?

OK, Callum.

But I didn't know there was a new one.

Is it near your house?

It's on the other side of town, actually.

Just opposite the swimming pool.

It's much better than the one near the cinema.

I hope it's bigger, too.

I don't mind if a skate park is old or dirty, but it has to have enough space.

Oh, yes.

Don't worry about that.

And the weather's never going to be a problem either.

This skate park's got a roof.

It's also got toilets and a cafe.

And they're going to put a shop there, too.

Wow!

Fantastic!

But how much do we have to pay to get in?

I've only got seven pounds to spend.

From next month when it's finished, it'll be five pounds.

But it's only three pounds until then.

Great!

Do you mind if we go early?

I've got to go to my aunties for lunch at one.

We could meet there at ten and stay until twelve.

If that's OK for you?

Yes, sure.

See you then.
