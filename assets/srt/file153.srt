Track 153

You will hear someone talking about a gym.

Thanks for visiting BodyFit Gym today.

Now I think you're all here because you're interested in our new club for teenagers.

Well, it starts next week and takes place every Saturday, but please book your place by this Friday.

Talk to your parents about it as soon as you get home.

The cost is £12.50 a month, which is a fantastic price.
Other clubs are £15 or even £20 a month.

About the time.
The club begins at 10.20, but it's a good idea to arrive by 10 o'clock, so you'll have time to get changed and meet the teacher.

His name's Huey.
That's H-U-G-H-I-E.
You can find out more about him on our website.

People always ask what they should wear.
Most kinds of comfortable sports clothes are fine, but trousers are a bad idea.
The gym gets very hot, so shorts are better.

Oh, and you don't need water as we have that here, but a towel is a good idea so you can dry yourself while you're exercising.

Okay, now any questions?
