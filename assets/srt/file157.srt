Track 157

One
You will hear a girl talking to her mother.
What does she want to eat?

Mum, I'm starving!
Sorry, dinner's not ready yet.
I can make you a sandwich if you like.
Or you could have a couple of biscuits.
Erm, I don't feel like a snack.
I need something big.
What are you cooking?
It's roast chicken.
Okay, I'll wait. That sounds really good.

Two
You will hear a girl talking to a friend about a TV programme.
What does she say about it?

Did you watch that show I told you about last night?
Yes. I usually only enjoy things that make me laugh.
But this was brilliant.
There was so much action.
I wasn't bored for a minute.
You didn't think it was too long?
You know, there was so much happening.
I didn't even notice it was two hours long.

Three
You will hear two friends talking about a walk they did together.
What happened on the walk?

Oh dear.
I'm not sure I want to do a walk like that again.
That was awful.
What? Just because of a tiny bit of rain.
I thought we did really well.
No accidents or broken bones.
And we had no problems following the map.
That's true. But I don't think my boots will ever get dry.
They will.

Four
You will hear a boy leaving a message for a friend.
Where would he like to meet his friend?

Freddy, it's Jackson.
Just getting in touch about the festival in the park tomorrow.
I'm going to get the bus from my house as far as the high street and then walk from there.
I need to go to the ticket office first.
So why don't you wait for me there?
Then we can go to see the first band at the big stage.
I'm really looking forward to it.

Five
You will hear a teacher talking to her class.
What is she talking about?

I'm pretty sure you're all going to love this one.
The writerâ€™s not very well known, but the story has been made into a film.
So you've probably all heard of it.
Oh, and it's not too long.
I know how important that is to some of you.
