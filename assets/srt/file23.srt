Track 23

Hello, we arrived this morning.

I'm a guest here with my mum and dad and my sister.

Oh yes, I remember. John isn't it? How can I help you?

It's our first time here in Moscow and we want to do some sightseeing this afternoon.
Can you give me some information about things to see please?

Yes, certainly. I can give you a small street map. Here it is.

We're here and the tourist information center is here. It's not very far.
You can easily get there on foot.

That's perfect. Thank you.

Do you have a guide book?

My mum and dad like having a guide book.
My sister and I think guide books are boring.
We think it's much more fun to use the internet to read about things to do in a city.

Yes, we have some guide books here. You have to pay for them though.

Okay, I'll tell mum and dad.
Oh, and do you have a metro map?

Yes, look, it's on the other side of the street map.
The best way to get around Moscow is by metro or by bus.
You can get day tickets for both.

What about taxis? Aren't they quicker?

Taxis are okay, but they can be expensive and quite slow.
There's always a lot of traffic, so they often take a long time.

Thank you. That's really useful information for mum and dad.
Bye.

Goodbye.

Oh, excuse me. You left your suitcase.

Pardon?

Isn't that your suitcase there on the floor?

No, that isn't mine. Mine's in our room.
I saw a man here at the desk before me.
He had lots of luggage. Perhaps it belongs to him.
He went up in the lift.

Ah, yes. I remember. I'll call his room.

Thank you.
