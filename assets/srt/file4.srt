Track 4.

What was Richard doing when his mum got home?

My mum was surprised when she came home yesterday.

Why was that, Richard?

I was in the kitchen, making some soup.

I don't like cooking, but there was no bread for a sandwich, and I was hungry.

Wow! Was it difficult?

No, not really.

What do Charlie and his family use their garage for?

Our house has a garage, but we don't keep our car in it.

What do you use it for then?

Well, I really want a table tennis table in there, but it's full of boxes of old things.

And my brother wants to practice in there with his band.

You'll have to take all the boxes away.

What did Rosie's dad buy yesterday?

Rosie, are you at home this afternoon?

I bought something yesterday, and the shop is bringing it at 2.

Are they here? Have you bought a new sofa?

We don't need one. It's a sink for the new kitchen.

We just have to find the right cooker now, then we'll have everything we need.

Who is on the balcony?

Who's that talking outside on the balcony?

Bethan and her friends.

One's Catherine, but I don't know the other girl with them.

I can hear a boy laughing too.

That's the TV.

Hannah's watching it in the sitting room.

What did Emma paint on her ceiling?

I finished painting my ceiling last night. It looks great.

Oh yes. What did you decide to paint on it? The sun or the stars?

Well, you know my ceilingâ€™s light grey, so the stars weren't right.

I decided to do clowns instead.

Good idea.
