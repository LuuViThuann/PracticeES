Track 8.

You will hear two friends talking on the way to school.

What did the girl forget to do before she left home?

Oh no!

I forgot to do something before I came out.

What?

You've got all your school things. I saw you get them.

I know, but the air conditioning's still on.

I needed it while I washed the plates and cups from breakfast.

Oh dear.

You will hear a girl talking about some train tickets.

What is she explaining?

When Mum and I were at Grandma's, we needed train tickets to come home.

Mum usually gets them online,

but Grandma hasn't got access to the internet at her cottage

and I couldn't use my phone there.

Mum tried to use Grandma's phone,

but the train company number was always busy.

So, she went to the station and got them there.

You will hear a boy and his mother talking about tomorrow evening.

Who does the boy need to talk to?

Michael, don't forget it's your brother Sam's birthday tomorrow,

so you can't go to basketball practice in the evening.

Oh, the other players think I'm playing.

Are we going to Sam's house?

I told you yesterday, we're going to the castle restaurant.

We booked it weeks ago.

Alright Mum, I'm still coming.

I just need to phone one of my team mates this evening and make other arrangements.

You will hear a boy telling his friend about breaking something.

What is he worried about?

I broke my grandmother's old wooden box yesterday.

I'm really annoyed.

I stood on it to get a book from a high shelf.

Oh no, what did your mum say?

She doesn't know yet.

She won't be angry, but grandma will be really sad about it.

I don't know how I'm going to tell her.

Perhaps you can repair it.

I don't think so.

You will hear a woman talking about the weather.

How will it change next week?

The weather will change a lot next week.

The good news is that there will be some rain for the first time in three weeks.

And the wind we're having this week will stop late this evening or early in the morning.

I know a lot of you will be delighted about that.

Temperatures will stay the same.
