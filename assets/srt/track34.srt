What day does Antonio play football?

Hi Antonio. Do you want to come to the cinema this week?

The new film Tuesday's Child is on.

Hi Anna. Yes, I'd love to see it. I'm not busy except for football practice.

That's Thursday right? So, let's see the film on Friday.

Great. Text me the time and we can meet there.

How much is a family ticket to the zoo today?

Hello. We'd like to come to the zoo today.

Well, you're very lucky. Our family tickets are usually £28.

But this week we have a special offer of £25.

But we only paid £22 last year?

Yes, that's right. It's a bit more this year. But we have more animals.

What time does the girls’ coach arrive?

Dad, can you pick me up from the coach station later?

Yes, sure. But I can't leave work until a quarter past three.

That's fine. I get in at five past three, but I've got some shopping to do.

So, let's meet at the coach station at half past three.

Perfect. See you later.

What is the number of Rosa's house?

Hi, Phil. Do you want to come to my house this evening to finish the geography project?

That's a good idea. Are you number 16 or 18 Green Street?

We're on the other side of the road at 17.

My friend lives at 16 and I don't know the people at 18.

Well, it's a good thing I asked. See you later.

What did Marco buy for his bedroom?

I went shopping today. I wanted to get something for my bedroom.

Did you get some new posters?

The posters weren't very interesting, but I saw some great desk lamps. I got a white one.

Now all you need is a bookshelf for all your books.
