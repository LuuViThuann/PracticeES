Track 94

You will hear Finley inviting a friend to the cinema.

Hi Anna.

I'm going to Star Cinema with a few friends for my birthday this weekend.
Can you come?

Sure.

Which day?

Well, it'll have to be Saturday because I've got a family dinner on Friday night and a football match on Sunday.

No problem.

What are we going to see?

Body Swap. I hope that's okay.

Yes, of course. All my friends say it's excellent.
Good acting, really funny and nice and short.
Most films are so long these days.

So what time does it start?

We're going to the show at 6.45.
If you like, we can pick you up on our way at 6.10.
We should get there by 6.30.

Oh, yes please.

How much are the tickets?

We're all 13 now, so it's a bit more expensive.
Instead of £7.50, it's £10.
Bring an extra £5 if you can for a drink or some popcorn.

Okay.

And how are we getting home?

I can get the 263 bus from the cinema, I think.

You don't have to. Mum will come and get us in the car.
I wanted to walk, but she says it's too far.

Okay. Thanks, Finley.
