Track 15

Hi, I'm Delec, and I come from Idirne in Turkey.

I've been a dancer for about six years.

I started when I was 10.

I do other free time activities,but I like this one best.

I dance in a group which usually meets once a week,

but sometimes we meet twice or more in a week if we need

to practice for a competition.

We haven't won any competitions yet, but that doesn't matter.

As well as dancing in competitions all around Turkey,
our group dances at weddings and birthday parties.

We dance to Turkish folk music, which I love.

When we practice, we wear normal jeans and t-shirts,
but at parties and competitions we wear special dresses and shoes.

Hi, I'm Borak, and I'm from Konya in Turkey.

The free time activity I enjoy most is playing a wooden Turkish musical instrument
called an ud that's spelled O-U-D.

It's very difficult to play, but it makes a beautiful sound.

It's really good to play for sad songs.

I've played it since I was six.

My dad plays it too, and he taught me.

I enjoyed learning because Dad likes the instrument so much and plays so well.

He plays in concerts and in a restaurant in my town, and sometimes I play with him.

I learned to play the guitar as well, but I prefer playing the ud.

I play it every night, and I'd like to be a professional ud player when I'm older.
