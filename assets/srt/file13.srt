Track 13.

I'm Rick Thomas, and with me on Active World today is the amazing climber, Agnes J.

Welcome Agnes.

Hi, thanks Rick.

Now Agnes, this is the first time you've ever been on a TV show. Is that right?

That's right, Rick. I've never been on TV before. It's a bit scary for me.

Scary, but you're a climber, Agnes. You're not scared of anything, are you?

But actually, have you ever been scared when climbing?

I always get excited, but not scared. You can't let yourself feel like that,
because you always need to think really clearly when you're climbing.

Yes, I see. Now, you usually climb with your husband, George, who's also a great climber,
and you have a son who's six years old. Does he climb?

Yes. His name's Billy. He loves climbing smaller rocks and the wall at our local sports centre.

You and your husband often climb in other countries. Has Billy ever been on a climbing trip with you?

No, he stays with my mum, his grandma. He might come with us when he's a bit older.

Right. So Agnes, what's the highest rock you've ever climbed?

Well, I've climbed 300 metres in a day. That's the most,
