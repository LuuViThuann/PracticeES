Track 7.

You will hear a teacher telling students about a trip.

Good morning everyone.

Before we get on the bus, I need to tell you some things about today.

As you know, we're going to Dolphin Island.

It's called that because you can often see these beautiful animals swimming there.

The bus is leaving soon to take us to the boat, and that goes at 11.30.

We'll get to the island at about 12 o'clock.

We're having a picnic lunch.

We'll eat on the beach and then walk through the forest to Woodside Castle.

A rich family built the castle 900 years ago, and it was the only building on the island for 200 years.

Now, there are holiday homes and hotels, as well as the activity centre.

We're going there for our activity, kayaking.

While we're there, look out for the zip wire.

It's fantastic. Maybe we'll do that next time.

After that, we're coming home.

If you have any problems today, you need to phone Mrs Murphy.

That's M-U-R-P-H-Y.

She and Mr Brown are coming with us.

I'll text you all her number in a minute, so you've got it on your phones.

Any questions?
