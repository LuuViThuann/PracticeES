Track 151.

Two. What is still in the car?

Did you bring everything in from the car?

I think so. My tennis kit, your jumper, and you brought in the shopping, didn't you?

One bag, but we had two. The other one's on the back seat, I think.

You're right. Okay, I'll get it.

Three. How much is the bag?

I'm looking for a school bag, but I've only got £20 to spend.

How much is this one?

Erm...

From today, that one is £15.

Oh, great! You're lucky. It was £17.75.

But it's in the sale now.

Four. Where did they go camping last year?

Mom, can we go camping again this summer? It was great fun last year.

It was lovely by that lake, wasn't it? Maybe we can find somewhere in the mountains next time.

I suppose so. Or near a beach.

A beach sounds good. Let's see what Dad thinks.

Five. What are the boys going to do now?

Shall we do something else now? I'm bored of playing computer games.

Me too. What about playing football in the park?

I haven't got my trainers with me. Let's go to that new cafe in town. They do great milkshakes.

Good idea. We can play football another time.
