Track 56

You will hear a teacher telling students about an adventure holiday.

Hello everyone.

I want to tell you about a new adventure holiday for this summer.

It's called Across the Water and it's going to be really great.

The holiday is from the 28th of July for a week.

Yes, most holidays are in August but ours is in July and August.

I think you're really going to like it because the group isn't too big.
We have four rooms so there is space for 16 students.

Last year's adventure holiday was beside the sea and everyone liked it.
This year it's near a river.

We're kayaking, zip wiring and even spending a few nights camping.

This holiday is £345 for the week and that includes everything.
It's even cheaper than last year when the price was £375.

Are you interested?
Then tell your parents about the holiday and get them to call me on 05371 255 946.

See you there.
