Track 31.

What is the number of Maria's house?

Excuse me, do you live on this street?

Yes I do. It's the fifth house on the right. The white one.

Oh yes, I can see. It's really pretty. It's opposite ours. Is yours 15 then?

Yes, that's right, it is. And yours is 25?

Which is Jason's house?

When you come to my party on Saturday Sally, you can see our new house.

Great. Is it much bigger than your old one?

Yes it is. The living roomâ€™s on the first floor and the bedrooms are on the ground floor.

Wow, I'd like to live on two floors. Our house has just one floor.

What time is Jenny going to leave school today?

Hi Jenny. You don't usually call me at ten past three. Is everything okay?

Yes Dad. I'm calling because I finished school at a different time today.

It's usually ten past four on Friday isn't it?

No Dad. It's ten past four on Thursday. Please come at ten to four today. That's twenty minutes earlier than usual.

What colour does Ben want to paint his bedroom?

Hello Ben. Are you going to help your dad paint your bedroom?

Yes, he prefers red but I don't like that colour very much. I like blue.

Oh, I don't like blue. How about green? It's nice and bright.

I'm sorry. I don't agree. I don't like green bedrooms.

What is Sarah going to do this afternoon?

Hi Sarah. Can we finish our homework project together this afternoon?

Oh sorry Tom. I can't. I'm going to make my mum's birthday cake after lunch.

Well, what about tomorrow then? I'm going to play football in the morning but I can come round after that.

Great. See you then.
