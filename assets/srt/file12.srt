Track 12.

You will hear Marina telling her friend Lucas about a film she is going to make.

Marina, are you coming with me and Sarah to this cinema on Friday evening?

I'm busy, I'm afraid, Lucas.

Oh, are you going out with friends from school?

That's right. From my film class at school.

We're planning a film for a competition.

It's about a large family.

OK. So, is it a film competition just for school students?

That's right.

Schools from around the country are entering.

So it's really important.

If we win this one, our school club can enter an international competition.

So, what kind of film is it?

Another comedy like your last one?

Actually, it's going to be a thriller.

This week we're planning the music and deciding how it might end.

So, when's the competition?

We have to send our film to the competition office before the 12th of June.

And they'll post the winner on their website on the 19th of June.

Then they'll show the winning film at a film festival on the 30th of June.

Right. So, where is the film festival?

Is it at the cinema in town?

Not this year. It's at the new film school.

It's not far from the arts centre.

Great. I can't wait.
